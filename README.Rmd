The goal of `rtapas` is to determine a subject-specific threshold to apply to multiple sclerosis lesion probability maps for automatic segmentation. This R package is based on the Thresholding Approach for Probability Map Automatic Segmentation (TAPAS) method. The methods are in progress for publication. This package creates data structures necessary for training the TAPAS model. After training, the model can be used to predict subject-specific thresholds to use on probability maps for automatic lesion segmentation. Methods can be extended outside of multiple sclerosis lesion segmentation but have not been validated.

## Installation

To get the latest development version from GitHub:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages('remotes')
library(remotes)
remotes::install_github('avalcarcel9/rtapas')
```

We are currently working to get the package on [Neuroconductor](www.neuroconductor.org).

## Function Documentation

The TAPAS package contains a number of functions to generate data required for training, train the TAPAS model, and predict subject-specific thresholds based on the trained TAPAS model. The functions, defaults, and usage are provided below.

### `tapas_data`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
tapas_data(thresholds = seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.01),
           pmap,
           gold_standard,
           mask,
           k = 8,
           subject_id = NULL,
           verbose = TRUE)
```

__Description__: 

This function creates the training vectors for a single subject from a probability map, a gold standard mask (normally a manual segmentation), and a brain mask. For a grid of thresholds provided and applied to the probability map the function calculates Sørensen's–Dice coefficient (DSC) between the automatic image and the gold standard image. The function also calculates the volume associated with thresholding at each respective threshold.

__Usage__:

- `thresholds` A `vector` of thresholds to apply to the probability map. The default
 `vector` applied is 0 to 1 by 0.01 increments. Threshold values must be between 0 and 1.
- `pmap` A `character` file path to a probability map image or an object of class `nifti`.
- `gold_standard` A `character` file path to a gold standard image (normally a manual segmentation) or an object of class `nifti`. The gold standard segmentation is used to compare the thresholded probability map image using Sørensen's–Dice coefficient (DSC).  
- `mask` A `character` file path to a brain mask image or an object of class `nifti`.  
- `k` The minimum number of voxels for a cluster/component. Passed to `extrantsr::label_mask`. Segmentation clusters of size less than k are removed from the mask, volume estimation, and the Sørensen's–Dice coefficient (DSC) calculation.
- `subject_id` A subject ID of class `character`. By default this is set to `NULL` but users must provide an ID.  
- `verbose` A `logical` argument to print messages. Set to `TRUE` by default.  

__Return__: 

A `tibble` containing the training data for a single subject. The data contains columns `threshold`, Sørensen's–Dice coefficient (`dsc`), and `volume`.

### `tapas_data_par`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
tapas_data_par(cores = 1,
               thresholds = seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.01),
               pmap,
               gold_standard,
               mask,
               k = 8,
               subject_id = NULL,
               ret = FALSE,
               outfile = NULL,
               verbose = TRUE)
```

__Description__: 

This function wraps `tapas_data` to run in parallel. This function creates the training vectors for all subjects from a probability map, a gold standard mask (normally a manual segmentation), and a brain mask. For a grid of thresholds provided and applied to the probability map the function calculates Sørensen's–Dice coefficient (DSC) between the automatic image and the gold standard image. The function also calculates the volume associated with thresholding at each respective threshold.

__Usage__:

- `cores` The number of cores to use. This argument controls at most how many child processes will be run simultaneously. The default is set to 1.  
- `thresholds` A `vector` of thresholds to apply to the probability maps. The default `vector` applied is 0 to 1 by 0.01 increments. Threshold values must be between 0 and 1.  
- `pmap` A `vector` of `character` file paths to probability map images or a `list` object with elements of class `nifti`.
- `gold_standard` A `vector` of `character` file paths to gold standard images (normally a manual segmentation) or a `list` object with elements of class `nifti`. The gold standard segmentation is used to compare the thresholded probability map image using Sørensen's–Dice coefficient (DSC).
- `mask` A `vector` of `character` file paths to brain mask images or a `list` object with elements of class `nifti`.  
- `k` The minimum number of voxels for a cluster/component. Passed to `extrantsr::label_mask`.
 Segmentation clusters of size less than k are removed from the mask, volume estimation, and the Sørensen's–Dice coefficient (DSC) calculation.  
- `subject_id` A `vector` of subject IDs of class `character`. By default this is set to `NULL` but users must provide an ID `vector`.
- `ret` A `logical` argument set to `TRUE` by default. Return the `tibble` objects from the function as a `list` in the local R environment. If `FALSE` then `outfile` must be specified so subject data is saved.
- `outfile` Is set to `NULL` by default which only returns the subject-level `tibble` as a list in the local R environment. To save each subject-level `tibble` as an R object specify a `vector` or `list` of file paths to save with either .rds or .RData extensions included.
- `verbose` A `logical` argument to print messages. Set to `TRUE` by default.  

__Return__: 

A `list` with the subject-level `tibble` object in each element returned from `tapas_data` for each subject. `ret` must be `TRUE` to return objects locally. To save objects a `vector` of `outfile` file paths must be provided.

### `tapas_train`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
tapas_train(data, 
            dsc_cutoff = 0.03, 
            verbose = TRUE)
```

__Description__: 

This function trains the TAPAS model using all binded subject-level `tibble`s produced from the `tapas_data` function. The TAPAS model is fit and clamp data is calculated. The clamp data contains the predicted threshold when using the 10th and 90th percentile volume from training data.

__Usage__:

- `data` Data resulting from `tapas_data`. The `data` should be a `tibble` or `data.frame` containing binded subject data or a `list` object with subject data in each element. Data from these subjects will be used for model training.  
- `dsc_cutoff` The Sørensen's–Dice coefficient (DSC) value to use as a cutoff for training inclusion. By default 0.03 is used. This must be a single value between 0 and 1. Only training subjects with a subject-specific threshold estimate resulting in Sørensen's–Dice coefficient (DSC) greater than or equal to the `dsc_cutoff` will be included in training the TAPAS model.  
- `verbose` A `logical` argument to print messages. Set to `TRUE` by default.  

__Return__: 

A `list` with the TAPAS model (`tapas_model`) of class `gam` and the a `tibble` with the clamp information (`clamp_data`). The clamp information contains the TAPAS-predicted smallest and largest threshold to be applied by using estimates related to the volume at the 10th and 90th percentile.

### `tapas_predict`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
tapas_predict(pmap, 
              model, 
              clamp = TRUE, 
              k = 8, 
              verbose = TRUE){
```

__Description__:

This function takes a probability map for a single subject and predicts the subject-specific threshold to apply based on the TAPAS model generated from `tapas_train`. The function will return a `list` of objects including the TAPAS predicted subject-specific threshold, the lesion mask produced from applying this threshold, and the lesion mask produced from using the group threshold.

__Usage__:

- `pmap` A `character` file path to a probability map image or an object of class `nifti`.
- `model` The TAPAS model fit from `tapas_train` of class `gam`. This model will be used to make subject-specific threshold predictions.
- `clamp` A `logical` object set to `TRUE` by default. This setting uses the clamped subject-specific threshold prediction rather than the prediction fit by the TAPAS `model`. This only applies to volumes exceeding those at the 10th and 90th percentile calculated using the training data. Using the clamp data avoids extrapolation when the naive volume estimate falls in the tails of the TAPAS model. If `FALSE` then the the TAPAS model predicted threshold will be used for segmentation rather than the clamped threshold. 
- `k` The minimum number of voxels for a cluster/component. Passed to `extrantsr::label_mask`. Segmentation clusters of size less than k are removed from the mask, volume estimation, and the Sørensen's–Dice coefficient (DSC) calculation.
- `verbose` A `logical` argument to print messages. Set to `TRUE` by default.

__Return__:

A `list` containing the TAPAS predicted subject-specific threshold (`subject_threshold`), the lesion segmentation mask obtained using the TAPAS predicted subject-specific threshold (`tapas_binary_mask`), and the lesion segmentation mask obtained using the group threshold (`group_binary_mask`).

### `tapas_predict_par`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
tapas_predict_par(cores = 1,
                  pmap,
                  subject_id,
                  model,
                  clamp = TRUE,
                  k = 8,
                  ret = FALSE,
                  outfile = NULL,
                  verbose = TRUE)
```

__Description__:

This function wraps `tapas_predict` to run in parallel. This function takes probability maps across subjects and predicts the subject-specific threshold to apply based on the TAPAS model generated from `tapas_train`. The function will return or save a list of objects for each subject including the TAPAS predicted subject-specific threshold, the lesion mask produced from applying this threshold, as well as the lesion mask produced from using the group threshold.

__Usage__:

- `cores` The number of cores to use. This argument controls at most how many child processes will be run simultaneously. The default is set to 1.
- `pmap` A `vector` of `character` file paths to probability map images or a `list` object with elements of class `nifti`.
- `subject_id` A `vector` of subject IDs of class `character`. By default this is set to `NULL` but users must provide an ID.
- `model` The TAPAS model fit from `tapas_train` of class `gam`. This model will be used to make subject-specific threshold predictions.
- `clamp` A `logical` object set to `TRUE` by default. This setting uses the clamped subject-specific threshold prediction rather than the prediction fit by the TAPAS model. This only applies to volumes exceeding those at the 10th and 90th percentile calculated using the training data. Using the clamp data avoids extrapolation when the naive volume estimate falls in the tails of the TAPAS model. If `FALSE` then the the TAPAS `model` predicted threshold will be used for segmentation rather than the clamped threshold. 
- `k` The minimum number of voxels for a cluster/component. Passed to `extrantsr::label_mask`. Segmentation clusters of size less than k are removed from the mask, volume estimation, and Sørensen's–Dice coefficient (DSC) calculation.
- `ret` A `logical` argument set to `TRUE` by default. Returns a nested `list` of objects from the function to the local R environement. If `FALSE` then `outfile` must be specified so subject data is saved.
- `outfile` Is set to `NULL` by default which only returns the subject-level `tibble` as a list in the local R environment. To save each subject-level `tibble` as an R object specify a `list` or `vector` of file paths to save with either .rds or .RData extensions included.
- `verbose` A `logical` argument to print messages. Set to `TRUE` by default.

__Return__:

A nested `list`. Each element in the list contains subject-level data returned from `tapas_predict`.
